Land to Kitchen is an online grocery store in Chennai. Our objective is to deliver farm fresh vegetables to customers like you, making online shopping for vegetables (and in time, more fruits) at an affordable price and simultaneously increase the revenue to the farmers to a higher sustenance level.

We source all the vegetables and fruits you have ordered directly from farmers. When a particular vegetable/fruit is off season and not available from any of our farmers, we procure it from a local market to fulfil your order.

The backbone of the supply chain from the farmer to the customer is this software, which provides greater transparency, enables consumers to place orders online on their computers or smartphones or by calling us directly. This reduces the non-value added costs and increases the efficiency of the supply chain.
